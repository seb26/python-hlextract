* Defrag function
** Need to return True / False depending on if it is successful (also if cmd fails due to non-volatile, need to return False somehow).
* Add debug mode to cmd_*() functions, to show exactly what is being fed to the executable.
* cmd_console() currently is never told to end its process. HLExtract.exe will run forever unless its process is killed via the task manager.
* Possibly modify cmd_*() to simply return the process object so commands can be passed to it. (e.g. x = self.cmd_console(); x.close())
* Need to modify cmd_close() to not demand a list of items to extract, or a directory to extract to.
