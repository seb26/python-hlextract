- Console command function based on HLExtract -c 
-- Add similar functions for most commands
- Validate function
- Defrag function
- Move some cmdline options to the outer class and make self.params store things like volatile
- Improve stoopid vpk / game option. Perhaps easier to simply specify the path to the vpk instead of requiring 'game' to be defined all the time.
